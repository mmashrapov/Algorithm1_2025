Problem 1

Connected + no cycles
A piece of a forest (forest = graph with no cycles)
Connected with exactly V-1 edges
Removing any edge breaks connectivity
No cycles + at least V-1 edges
Adding any edge creates a cycle
Exactly one path between any two vertices



1 → 2:
If we have a connected acyclic graph (Def 1), then it's automatically one connected component. 
A forest is defined as an acyclic graph, so our graph is one component of a forest

2 → 1:
If it's one component of a forest, then by definition it's connected (one component) and acyclic (since forests are acyclic)

1 → 3:
A connected acyclic graph must have exactly V-1 edges. Let me prove this by induction:
Base case: V=1, 0 edges 
Assume true for V=k vertices
Add vertex k+1: to maintain connectivity without cycles, we need exactly 1 new edge
So for V=k+1, we have (k-1)+1 = k edges 
If we had fewer than V-1 edges, the graph couldn't be connected; if more, cycles would appear

3 → 4:
A connected graph with exactly V-1 edges is minimally connected. Why? If we remove any edge, we'd have V-2 edges, 
which is insufficient to connect V vertices (minimum V-1 edges needed for connectivity)

4 → 5:
A minimally connected graph must be acyclic. If there were a cycle, we could remove any edge from that cycle without disconnecting the graph, 
contradicting minimal connectivity. Since it's conected and minimal it has exactly V-1 edges, which satisfies "acyclic with at least V-1 edges"

5 → 6:
An acyclic graph with at least V-1 edges must have exactly V-1 edges(since more would create cycles). 
This makes it maximally acyclic: adding any edge between non-adjacent vertices would create a cycle (because there's already exactly 1 path between them)

6 → 7:
A maximally acyclic graph has unique paths between all vertices. If there were no path between two vertices, 
we could add an edge without creating a cycle. If there were multiple paths between vertices, a cycle would already exist

7 → 1:
If there's a unique path between each pair of vertices, the graph is clearly connected. 
It's also acyclic because any cycle would provide two different paths between the same vertices
